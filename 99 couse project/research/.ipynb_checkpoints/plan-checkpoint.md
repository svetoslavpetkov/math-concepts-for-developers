# Implmentation plan

1. Gather initial resources
2. Describe the HyperLogLog approach 
3. Implement it in python
4. Get public data for testing purposes
5. Test implmentation


# Optional furhter research
* Sliding window improvement
  - Describe the algorithm
  - Implement it
  - Test it with same set of samle data
  - Compare it with original implementation

* Bias correction from HyperLogLog plus plus
  - Describe the algorithm
  - Implement it
  - Test it with same set of samle data
  - Compare it with original implementation
